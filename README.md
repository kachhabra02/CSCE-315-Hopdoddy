# Sprint Information
## Details
Meeting agendas and minutes will be uploaded to the SprintDocuments folder.
### Sprint Planning Meeting
Before the start of each sprint, the team will review its backlog and decide what items to prioritize for the upcoming sprint.
By the end of a sprint planning meeting, the team will have two items:
1. a sprint goal (a summary of the plan for the next sprint)
2. the sprint backlog (the list of tasks the team will work on during the sprint)

### Daily Scrum Meeting
During each sprint, the team will meet "daily" (every class/lab day) to plan out its work for the day and identify any obstacles that could impact that work.  These meetings are also called "standup" meetings because they are often conducted while standing to emphasize that the meeting should be short and focused.  But, you can have them sitting down, too.  The important thing is short and focused.

The 2020 version of the Scrum Guide dropped the classic “three questions” of the Daily Scrum (Scrum.orgLinks to an external site.).  Instead, try the following.

1. Set a timer for 15 minutes.  When it goes off, the meeting is over.
2. The Scrum Master begins each meeting by reading aloud the Sprint Goal.
3. Conduct a "fist of five" vote on the question “How likely are we to achieve the Sprint Goal?”
  1. Fist of Five: On a scale of 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest)...
  2. If the result shows low confidence (average fist < 3), each team member should make a brief statement about what is holding them back.
4. Examine the Sprint Backlog. For each Sprint Backlog Item (SBI) that is in progress, ask:
  1. What would it take to finish this SBI?
  2. Who can work on those tasks?
5. If there is still time remaining and it makes sense to start something new,
  1. select something from the Sprint Backlog that hasn't yet been started.
  2. ask the same questions about what needs to be done and who can do it.

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting
At the completion of each sprint, the team will review what happened during the sprint to determine what worked, what didn’t work, and how they can improve the process during the next sprint.  In the retrospective meeting, the team should discuss:
1. what went right and wrong during the previous sprint
2. what changes (if any) need to be made regarding procedure
3. what adjustments might need to be made to the product backlog 
The retrospective must be completed before the next sprint backlog is determined.
